# PS2-CD-Burning

## About
Hey there! This was a summer project of me trying my best to restore and play on my playstation 2 that I previously owned for many years. I got from an unofficial store at that time, and it had a lot of games (Obv they were all cracked). In this tutorial I will be helping you on how to install and burn games to the fresh DvD/CD that you own.

## Playstation version and type
First let's discover the playstation version. I had a playstation 2 slim that was originally from japan, and I bought it from one of the GCC countries. [image of ps2 type]
For every playstation, there is the region for the country that was bought from (It's locked to the games from the same region). Most of the middle eastern Playstations where modded or unlocked in a way or another. When I searched to find how my ps2 was modded I didnt find any resources, but there was leading evidence that made me realize that it was modded originally, and you may try to identify your own signs like me.
My playstation was from japan, so it should have the x button has a replaced impact with o button, also the triangle button should be replaced with the o button impact in the main menu with no disc. On the other hand, my playstation had normal x and o like any other regions. another evidence was that my old CD's didnt seem to be original. They had the pengoin logo which is a major leading evidence on how your CD isn't origianl. In addition to, the game that I've used to love and play on daily bassis didn't even launch in japan. Finally, the sticker for the model and serial no. was shifted upward.

With these evidence we may conclude that My playstation 2 was obviously cracked with a mod chip!
Take care that this version of playstation 2 PlayStation 2 (SCPH-9000x) models can't be even modded with freemcboot, so it's an inside chip. I've tried FreeDvDBoot but it didn't work with me, but it should work with you.

### So how to discover your playstation version?
Easiest way is to see on your back of the playstation, if it has NTSC-J then it's from japan. If it has NTSC-U/C that means it's from United States and Canada. If it had PAL that means it's from europe.

## Game Files
After you discovered your playstation version, download your game rom or copy the original cd you've got. There are alot of rom sites, use what you like.

## Edit Game files
After you get the iso for the Ps2 game, download DiscPatcher (included in the folder but thanks for the makers of this tool, here is the original file online https://www.psx-place.com/resources/psx-ps2-disc-patcher.1156/). [disc patcher image online]
Get you game iso, tap on the region that your playstation is orignally from. Also tick on the master disc option. 

### Disc options
I've read multiple articles on which type of DVD and CD to choose from. Mainly choose the DVD-R to burn. Also prefered to use DVD as alot of games on the ps2 are above 1 GB.
After you know what type of Disc you will burn on, choose it, then choose ps2. Make sure you've clicked the right choices then click Patch. It will deploy a message that tells you finished.

## Burn the iso
Install imgburner application. Get your CD/DVD inside the tray. Choose from imgburn (iso to burn on the DVD). CLick burn on the same speed.
Note that I've watched a tutorial that changes the sector number, But it won't make a difference I guess.
Wait until the DVD gets burnt and voilla you have now a ps2 burnt game that you can play whenever you feel like doing
